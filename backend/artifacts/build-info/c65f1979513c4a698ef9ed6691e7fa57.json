Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":315,"linearizedBaseContracts":[315,2475,2487,513,2276],"name":"AccessControl","nameLocation":"1824:13:0","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"canonicalName":"AccessControl.RoleData","id":19,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":16,"mutability":"mutable","name":"members","nameLocation":"1930:7:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":19,"src":"1905:32:0","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_address_$_t_bool_$","typeString":"mapping(address => bool)"},"typeName":{"id":15,"keyName":"","keyNameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","keyType":{"id":13,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1913:7:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"nodeType":"Mapping","src":"1905:24:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_address_$_t_bool_$","typeString":"mapping(address => bool)"},"valueName":"","valueNameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","valueType":{"id":14,"name":"bool","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1924:4:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bool","typeString":"bool"}}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":18,"mutability":"mutable","name":"adminRole","nameLocation":"1955:9:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":19,"src":"1947:17:0","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":17,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1947:7:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"name":"RoleData","nameLocation":"1886:8:0","nodeType":"StructDefinition","scope":315,"src":"1879:92:0","visibility":"public"},{"constant":false,"id":24,"mutability":"mutable","name":"_roles","nameLocation":"2014:6:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":315,"src":"1977:43:0","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_bytes32_$_t_struct$_RoleData_$19_storage_$","typeString":"mapping(bytes32 => struct AccessControl.RoleData)"},"typeName":{"id":23,"keyName":"","keyNameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","keyType":{"id":20,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1985:7:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"Mapping","src":"1977:28:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_bytes32_$_t_struct$_RoleData_$19_storage_$","typeString":"mapping(bytes32 => struct AccessControl.RoleData)"},"valueName":"","valueNameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","valueType":{"id":22,"nodeType":"UserDefinedTypeName","pathNode":{"id":21,"name":"RoleData","nameLocations":["1996:8:0"],"nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":19,"src":"1996:8:0"},"referencedDeclaration":19,"src":"1996:8:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_struct$_RoleData_$19_storage_ptr","typeString":"struct AccessControl.RoleData"}}},"visibility":"private"},{"constant":true,"functionSelector":"a217fddf","id":27,"mutability":"constant","name":"DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE","nameLocation":"2051:18:0","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":315,"src":"2027:49:0","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":25,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"2027:7:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"value":{"hexValue":"30783030","id":26,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"2072:4:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_0_by_1","typeString":"int_const 0"},"value":"0x00"},"visibility":"public"},{"body":{"id":37,"nodeType":"Block","src":"2495:44:0","statements":[{"expression":{"arguments":[{"id":33,"name":"role","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":30,"src":"2516:4:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}}],"expression":{"argumentTypes":[{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}],"id":32,"name":"_checkRole","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[92,131],"referencedDeclaration":92,"src":"2505:10:0","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_function_internal_view$_t_bytes32_$returns$__$","typeString":"function (bytes32) view"}},"id":34,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"kind":"functionCall","lValueRequested":false,"nameLocations":[],"names":[],"nodeType":"FunctionCall","src":"2505:16:0","tryCall":false,"typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_tuple$__$","typeString":"tuple()"}},"id":35,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"2505:16:0"},{"id":36,"nodeType":"PlaceholderStatement","src":"2531:1:0"}]},"documentation":{"id":28,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2083:375:0","text":" @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role.

of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.
